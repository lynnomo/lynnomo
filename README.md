- 👋 Hi, I’m @lynnomo
- 👀 I’m interested in nudibranchs (sea slugs), marine biology/ecology, evolution, and molecular work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and working on relearning R for advancing my computer skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently, but reach out if you are interested in collaborating.
- 📫 How to reach me - send me a message through twitter (link in github) or through github.
